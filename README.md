## Welcome to our very cool game! 
Our game takes inspiriation from the classic game Galaga, we have mixed in elements from other titles to create a unique experience where you are a dragon fighting back against aliens that are invading earth!

Here is how it works:

- using the arrow keys or WASD move throughout the level avoiding enemy fire in hopes of reaching the end of the level
- As a dragon you will be shooting fire balls (Pressing Space) in hopes to bring down enemy ships to earn points towards your highscore!
- Collecting the souls of aliens grants you recharge on your quick dash ability to avoid enemey fire in a pitch
- Between levels choose a power-up to better equip yourself for the next level, these stack so choose wisely!
- After reaching the end of level 3 there will be a boss you must take on!
- After defeating level 3 , its a never ending cycle of levels and boss battles until you finally go down.
- Your goal is to elimate as many aliens as possible and achieve the highest score good luck!
